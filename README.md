# Ignite Life Bowen Therapy

This is the reactive frontend for Ignite Life Bowen Therapy. Developed with Next.js and soon to be integrated with a Laravel backend, this project aims to create a responsive and intuitive user interface for a booking system. The admin panel is meticulously designed to prioritize simplicity and ease of use.

The current site is operating in a front-end only mode, displaying minimal placeholder data. As such, full functionality and backend connectivity are not yet available. Once a basic thing of the admin panel and backend is finished the landing page will then be developed.
